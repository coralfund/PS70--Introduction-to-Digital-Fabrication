        Project Idea: Using Arduino to create effects for neopixel LED strip
    </div>
    <div>
       Although Microcontrollers have many applications, the one that caught my attention was LED lights. With the help of my professor, I was able to solder 3 wires to the LED strip- to ground, 5V and out, and light up the LED. 
       Once the LED was lit up, I was able to use many libraries, including but not limited to - Neopixel painter, Adafruit Neomatrix Zero DMA library and Fast LED to produce more than 5 effects.

        What I am using? 
        Neopixel high denity lights, on and off switch, arduino uno and wires.

      The lights look immaculate and the effects are easy to change by flirting with the hue value, effect type and time for effects, albeit only seen with a 6 LED strip.
