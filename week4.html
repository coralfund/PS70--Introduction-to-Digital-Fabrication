        Project Idea for 3d printer: Baroque Bathtub, Barrel and Trigger
    </div>
    <div>
        I wanted to originally print out a snake skeleton but my request at morpheus was never processed. 
        So, I decided to 3d print parts of a gun- an aspect of 3d printing that has long enthused the community.
        Realizing this application was perhaps too ego-driven I shifted my attention to using 3d printing techniques to repurpose desigs for new purposes. 
        The bathtub I show here is originally a vase from the Waddesdon Collection, the only of 44 houses built by the famous banking Rothschild family, located between London and Oxford.

      The trigger and barrel prints are of robust and durable quality, and they were manufactured naught to completion in less than 3 hours cumulitatively.
