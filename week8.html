<h3>Recycling Wax Mold with Chase and Nathan</h3>
<p> 
    <a href="">New Wax Mold</a>
    <div>
        This week's assignment was conducted in Science Center Basement and not the usual Fab Lab.

        Noon on a Thursday, Chase and I arrived to learn how to recycle wax moulds from Nathan, ahead of thanksgiving break. 
        The first step was to melt the wax. The second to even the bricks of re-melted wax by cutting off the abrasive uneven layer. The third step was to collect the shavings from the second step and put them back into first step for creating more bricks.

        We did this all while talking about ocean plastic recycling's future and paper recycling applications I did in high school. Today while I read about the success fission experiment at the NNSA labs and first successful CO2-fuel-based run of the Air Company I think back of those grand visions we discussed that day remolding Prussian Blue wax.

      The trigger and barrel prints are of robust and durable quality, and they were manufactured naught to completion in less than 3 hours cumulitatively.
