        Selecting the final project: I came up with 4 other ideas to work on besides the POV, which are as follows:
        A. Tooth Mounted Chip to track diet- This ideas was inspired by a Tufts research article that used a combination of silk and gold to track the quality of the food. I eversince wondered what this device would be like if it could give continuous data on diet. After much research, I had to abandon this project because it was more biochemistry heavy but I learned a lot about silicone minituarization, non-invasive biotracking and nutrition.
        B. IoT Ring- An iot ring that would connect to all devices and eventually a laser based headset.
        C. Matcha Machine- A Keurig for matcha.
        D. Perfume Burner- Inspired by the 1960 3 foot solid silver perfume burner designed by Phillip Rolles for the Chatsworth Estate. 
        E. LUI (Laser User Interface)- Designing an AR heatset that used a system of lasers to form images, as opposed to GUI interfaces.

        Ultimately, I found it a more suitable subject to focus on building a Laser Persistence of Vision, while aligned more with the themes of the class.

        Why? 
        I wanted to learn how to make LED acrylic sign boards and this was an impromptu version that I created whilst I took time off from my final project fixtures.   
    </div>
    <div>
        What I am using? 
        Handsaw for cutting wood 
        Handsaw for cutting acrylic 
        Drill with engraving forefront to mark the "PS"
        Printer for getting the rainbow design 
        LED lights to glorify the design
