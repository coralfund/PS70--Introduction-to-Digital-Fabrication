  <b> Weekly Assignment 1: Create a press-fit construction kit that can be assembled in multiple ways, and accounts for lasercutter kerf. 
    Work through a Fusion 360 tutorial and document what you produce.
    Select at least 2 household objects or components from the lab. Measure them using calipers, and model them in Fusion 360 (or other program). Create an assembly using these components, and document your work on your webpage. You may also incorporate items from other 3D model repositories like GrabCad. </b>

      <div>
          Why? 
          Apps like Ritual and Snackpass exist in North America. However, there is nothing like this in the EU or India.

      <div>
          I printed out this design as an early visualization and printed them on the back of a black film sheet. 
          I had 2 other designs that were more complex and not good for printing as they had a lot of fine lines.

        Project Idea: 1. Avant garde collage with laser printed reflexive sheets cut in flowery form and pasted on wood. 2. Tiny Alberto Giacometti - FX: Sotheby's https://www.sothebys.com/giacometti.

    <div>
        Why? 
        I wanted to learn how to make LED acrylic sign boards and this was an impromptu version that I created whilst I took time off from my final project fixtures.   
    </div>
    <div>
        What I am using? 
        Handsaw for cutting wood 
        Handsaw for cutting acrylic 
        Drill with engraving forefront to mark the "PS"
        Printer for getting the rainbow design 
        LED lights to glorify the design
