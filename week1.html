  <p> Week 1. Introduction and documentation </p> 
  <p> An overview of the weekly assignments and projects as viewable on the next webpages: 
    Originally, I came up with 50 other ideas. I'll briefly illustrate ten namely: </p>
<p> 
  Goethe -  <i> "Life is short, art is long!" </i>
  </p>
<p>  Dhruv - <i> "Options, Futures, which one to bet against?" </p> </i>
  <h4><u> Executive Summary: </u> </h4>
       <ol> 
  
        <p><li> <b>WisdomToof: </b> This idea was inspired by a Tufts research article that used a combination of silk and gold to track the quality of the food but not the body's reaction to it. I eversince wondered what this device would be like if a more durable and robust tooth chip could give continuous data on diet and engaged Dan and a nutritionalist from the Hi Labs to finesse this product. After much research, I had to abandon this project because it was more biochemistry up but I learned a lot about silicone minituarization, non-invasive biotracking and nutrition and generally biochemistry down as expected from a Physics course. The device could perform multiple functions- measuring pH levels, tracking intake, quality and response of foods, drinks, smokes or aromas. Dan envisioned mounting a 3print the device like a walkman and put the sensor chip in there to make it durable. 
        <a href='./ThingRing (1).pdf' download > ThingRing's Pitchdeck !</a>
        <li> <b>Thing Ring:</b> An iot ring that would connect to all devices and eventually a laser based headset.</li>
        <li> <b>Matcharichtual:</b> A Keurig for matcha with premium pods blessed by the Zen Monastary in Bosto</li>   
        <li> <b>ToofBraces "Das, Auto": </b> Bracesthat automatically brush teeth. This would involved fun imagine and ML applications.</li>
        <li> <b>LUI (Laser User Interface): </b> Designing an AR heatset that used a system of lasers to form images, as opposed to GUI interfaces has been a dream of mine for 3 years.</li> 
        <li><b> Perfume Burner/ Smell Furniture: </b>- A travelling device for people who are on the go to calm down with fun smelss, medtiations apps and integerations with other wellness provicers to relax with aroma, a sonos for smell, smell furniture. Inspired by the 1690 3 foot solid silver perfume burner designed by Phillip Rolles for the Chatsworth Estate, which is visible on the top of the page was my first official proposal. The immediacey of the object is timeless. </li>
        <li> <b> Eyeglasses Cleaner: </b> machine automatically cleans glasses like a Rosenburg Machine</li>
        <li> <b> Lippen Schticken: </b> Juul for makeup (particularly lipstick) that can take in any color and dispense a one time color. I had this idea 4 years ago and saw a first potential competitor in Berlin, 2022. Their product was not sophisticated or sleep like a Juul.
        <li> <b> UDIT/ Kineticia: </b> A mat that conserved the energy generated by movement of people and powers appliances. The general idea of capturing electricity being from a revolving door in the science center or the souls of the shoes is very attractive.
        <li> <b> ZAOUI/ Swiss Army Cosmetics </b> After working with Russian models in Germany, I learned a lot about tthe gaps in the makeup market. Two immedictae needs that I identified, which could be catered to are 1. Modular and fully-customisable "pleasing to touch materials" Travel Bags, with high thread count and not an acrylic logo, which are lifelong gifts, built robustly and cheap to upgrade with a list of your new makeup (Eye, Face and Lips). Full details are in the <a href='./ZAOUI (1).pdf' download > Zaoui Research Doc !</a>). 2. Big Make up repair kit with mini instructions and 3. One day lip fillers, milt plastic surgery solutions and Permanent Makeup. This is the creed of Zaoui!
        <li> <b> Phone cover that blocks the microphone: </b> This would require some fun measuremenents and 3d printing. </li>
        <p>  Ultimately after speaking with Nathan, I found it a more agreeable subject to focus on building a Laser Persistence of Vision, while aligned more with the themes of the class.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>  Week 2. 2D Design & Cutting
          <li>Designing a minimalist laser cut fit construction piece. I made a small rotating sculpture with 2 laser cut pieces, a hard-to-bend wire, and a motor. I would like to make bigger pieces like this and eventually get deeper into automata or mechanical theatre and kinetic sculptures. I tired to print many other things but they failed, either needing too much precision or both. </li>

        Why? 
        I wanted to learn how to make LED acrylic sign boards and this was an impromptu version that I created whilst I took time off from my final project fixtures.   
    </div>
    <div>
        What I am using? 
        Handsaw for cutting wood 
        Handsaw for cutting acrylic 
        Drill with engraving forefront to mark the "PS"
        Printer for getting the rainbow design 
        LED lights to glorify the design
