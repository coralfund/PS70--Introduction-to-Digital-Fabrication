  <p> Week 1. Introduction and documentation </p> 
  <p> An overview of the weekly assignments and projects as viewable on the next webpages: 
    Originally, I came up with 4 other ideas to work on besides the POV, which are as follows: </p>
<p> 
  Goethe - "Life is short, art is long!"
  </p>
<p>  Dhruv - "Options, Futures, which one to bet against?" </p>
<h4> Executive Summary </h4>
       <ul> 
  
        <p><li>ChipToof- This idea was inspired by a Tufts research article that used a combination of silk and gold to track the quality of the food but not the body's reaction to it. I eversince wondered what this device would be like if a more durable and robust tooth chip could give continuous data on diet and engaged Dan and a nutritionalist from the Hi Labs to finesse this product. After much research, I had to abandon this project because it was more biochemistry up but I learned a lot about silicone minituarization, non-invasive biotracking and nutrition and generally biochemistry down as expected from a Physics course. The device could perform multiple functions- measuring pH levels, tracking intake, quality and response of foods, drinks, smokes or aromas. Dan envisioned mounting a 3print the device like a walkman and put the sensor chip in there to make it durable.

        <li> Thing Ring- An iot ring that would connect to all devices and eventually a laser based headset.</li>
        <li> Matchagrade- A Keurig for matcha.</li>   
        <li> Rolles Perfume Burner- Inspired by the 1960 3 foot solid silver perfume burner designed by Phillip Rolles for the Chatsworth Estate. </li>
        <li> LUI (Laser User Interface)- Designing an AR heatset that used a system of lasers to form images, as opposed to GUI interfaces.</li> </p>
        </p>
        <p>Ultimately, I found it a more suitable subject to focus on building a Laser Persistence of Vision, while aligned more with the themes of the class.

    <div>
        Why? 
        I wanted to learn how to make LED acrylic sign boards and this was an impromptu version that I created whilst I took time off from my final project fixtures.   
    </div>
    <div>
        What I am using? 
        Handsaw for cutting wood 
        Handsaw for cutting acrylic 
        Drill with engraving forefront to mark the "PS"
        Printer for getting the rainbow design 
        LED lights to glorify the design
