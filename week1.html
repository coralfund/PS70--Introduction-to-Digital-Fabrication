<b>The objective of taking the class was to supplement my declaration of a concenteration in Art, Film, Visual Studies. </b>
I returned to Harvard College after a 3 year period where I lived and worked in India and Germany. Before my leave of absence, I had studied the sphere of CS and AFVS what used to be then "VES for Visual and Environmental Studeis". My original concenteration then was Comparative Study of Religion. I was interested in making my own concenteration combining Comparative Studies of Religion and VES, and seeking the permission of Diana L. Eck, who receieved a painting from me as a house gift and encouraged me to study Religion. The thesis we had in mind was "Epic Paintings" like those of Alphonse Mucha who made 20 "Slav Epic" Canvases between 1911-1934. I took intermeditate and advanced courses on the intersection of Religion and VES, but I found my aspiration to be a climbing task. I needed a lot more time and planning so I leaned in more to Religion, which I later found to be too academic to design a blueprint. I gave up. I got a summer internship in India to work at a Distressed Asset Management Company where I learned more about other applications of AI - automated microlending systems, loan origination on the internet, human processesing of loan application in the backoffices, requirements for mortgages, and the new Isolvency Act. I had returned to Harvard to study CS but after failing 2 classes I was asked to withdraw in 2019- when I went to work at a startup in Berlin. I enjoyed Germany so much that I stayed there for 3 years where my attention went back into the field of art, technology and culture. During the first week of class I was sitting with this background and inner monologue.

And so: First week of PS70, I conceptualized over fifty ideas and got to builing one of them- SpinkformTM ie a fork that spins on a small motor encased in 3-d printed case that can work as a handheld device. I followed the class and downloaded fusion and arduino for the coming weeks.
This process makes me want to explore the viability of creating a concenteration again that blends aspects of Physical Fabrication with Digital Fabrication- AFVS with electronics, woodwork, metallurgy and broadly speaking "tech" for the world of technology and general discipline of Information. 
Later in the course we came up with a final project idea- to make a pov with multiple colors. A state of the art effort in that POVs exist but have limited functionality- usually only one color and without text, logos and images.
