  <p> Week 1. Introduction and Documentation: An outline with no-code.  </p> 
  <p> An overview of the weekly assignments and projects as viewable on the next webpages: 
    Originally, I came up with 50 other ideas. I'll briefly illustrate ten I would like to continue making: </p>
<p> 
  Goethe -  <i> "Life is short, art is long!" </i>
  <h4><u> Executive Summary: </u> </h4>
       <ol> 
  
        <p><li> <b> Silk Molar: </b> This idea was inspired by a Tufts research article that used a combination of silk and gold to track the quality of the food but not the body's reaction to it. I eversince wondered what this device would be like if a more durable and robust tooth chip could give continuous data on diet and engaged Dan and a nutritionalist from the Hi Labs to finesse this product. After much research, I had to abandon this project because it was more biochemistry up but I learned a lot about silicone minituarization, non-invasive biotracking and nutrition and generally biochemistry down as expected from a Physics course. The device could perform multiple functions- measuring pH levels, tracking intake, quality and response of foods, drinks, smokes or aromas. Dan envisioned mounting a 3print the device like a walkman and put the sensor chip in there to make it durable. 
        <a href='./ThingRing (1).pdf' download > ThingRing's Pitchdeck !</a>
        <li> <b>Thing Ring:</b> An iot ring that would connect to all devices and eventually a laser based headset.</li>
        <li> <b>ToothBraces "Das ist Auto": </b> Bracesthat automatically brush teeth. This would involved fun imagine and ML applications.</li>
        <li> <b>Laser User Interface (LUI): </b> Designing an AR heatset that used a system of lasers to form images, as opposed to GUI interfaces has been a dream of mine for 3 years. The starting point for this was learning about Laser Keyboards. </li> 
        <li><b> Perfume Burner/ Smell Furniture: </b>- A travelling device for people who are on the go to calm down with fun smelss, medtiations apps and integerations with other wellness provicers to relax with aroma, a sonos for smell, smell furniture. Inspired by the 1690 3 foot solid silver perfume burner designed by Phillip Rolles for the Chatsworth Estate, which is visible on the top of the page was my first official proposal. The immediacey of the object is timeless. </li>
        <li> <b> Lens Cleaner: </b> machine automatically cleans glasses like a Rosenburg Machine</li>
        <li> <b> Lipschtik: </b> Juul for makeup (particularly lipstick) that can take in any color and dispense a one time color. I had this idea 4 years ago and saw a first potential competitor in Berlin, 2022. Their product was not sophisticated or sleep like a Juul.
        <li> <b> UDIT/ Kineticia: </b> A mat that conserved the energy generated by movement of people and powers appliances. The general idea of capturing electricity being from a revolving door in the science center or the souls of the shoes is very attractive.
        <li> <b> ZAOUI/ Swiss Army Cosmetics/ Arduino for Makeup </b> 
          After working with Russian models in Germany, I learned a lot about three gaps in the makeup market. <ol> 
            <li> <b>Modular and fully-customisable Travel Cases </b> made with "pleasing to touch materials" and 3d printed interiors designed for your colleciton. There is nothing out there with high thread count but there is a lot out there with acrylic logos. Something that is not your regular plastic containers reused for makeup but specifically bespoke and designed for makeup is useful- avoids colors mixing, travels lighter and intuitively organizes. These custom boxes are lifelong gifts, built robustly and cheap to upgrade with a list of your new makeup (Eye, Face and Lips)- and there 2 unicorns have merged in this space in the last 2 years. Full details on how to make an all-in-one make up gadget is in the <a href='./ZAOUI (1).pdf' download > Zaoui Research (All the tools out there) !</a>). </li>
            <li> Pastel minimal <b> make up repair kits </b> with clear and complete instructions like PS-70's website or the tutorials we follow in class fx: Arduino but for Cosmetic tools. Coincideteri Oppositorium! </li>
            <ol> Pushing the envelope on new promising albeit contradictory areas, namely- 
            <ol>   <b> <li>One-day lip fillers, </li> 
            <li> Mild Plastic Surgery Solutions </li> 
             <li>Permanent Makeup </li> </b> </ol>
            </ol>
          </ol>
             Lastly, in the Zaoui doc is a list of all the precision types and angles, which feel a lot like Drill Bits. This would increase education, aesthetic literary and curb waste not to mention save space, which is why I love the idea but it will take considerably more time and energy than I am prepared for at the moment. </p>
           In short, Zaoui is about exploring what's possible in the futures of: 
              <li>3-D Nail Print </li>
              <li>Mascara </li>
              <li>Eyeliners </li>
              <li>Piercing </li>
              <li>Lipsticks</li>
              <li>Highlighters </li> 
              <li>Bronzers. </li> 
              With an all-in-one and high-design approach.
              
              </ul>
              </ol>
            </li>
        <li> <b> Phone cover that blocks the microphone: </b> This would require some fun measuremenents and 3d printing. </li>
        <li> <b> Matcha Fountain:</b> I got my hands on a Keurig and I could not help wonder about the match with matcha for premium pods that were crafted with high-quality attention by the Zen Monastary in Boston, it takes months to get real good matcha. </li>   
        
        <p>  Ultimately after speaking with Nathan, I found it a more agreeable subject to focus on building a Laser Persistence of Vision, while aligned more with the themes of the class. I have also been offered by a tradefair company to sell my POV to them, although my project cannot to-date display logos and company brands in an animated display or holographic way. It's still nice that I got the offer, and the POV with a little planning and procureent can be much cooler.

        </ol>
        <p> Week 2. 2D Design & Cutting.
          <ol>
            <li> 
        Designing a minimalist laser cut fit construction piece. I made a small rotating sculpture with 2 laser cut pieces, a hard-to-bend wire, and a motor. I would like to make bigger pieces like this and eventually get deeper into automata or mechanical theatre and kinetic sculptures. I tired to print many other things but they failed, either needing too much precision or both.

        <li>In class assignment: I had designed a logo for <a href="./enyaapplogo.png"> Enya app </a>, which I printed on a glossy one-side sticky sheet to get a <a href="./week3m.jpeg"> Laptop Sticker </a>
        <li>Conceptualized the spinfork, Failing to capture a 3d scan as when my turn came Revopoint's product stopped working and the other scanner's software was nalicious to my computer. To be fulfiilled!</li>
         </p>  
         </ol>

    <div>
        Why? 
        I wanted to learn how to make LED acrylic sign boards and this was an impromptu version that I created whilst I took time off from my final project fixtures.   
    </div>
    <div>
        What I am using? 
        Handsaw for cutting wood 
        Handsaw for cutting acrylic 
        Drill with engraving forefront to mark the "PS"
        Printer for getting the rainbow design 
        LED lights to glorify the design
