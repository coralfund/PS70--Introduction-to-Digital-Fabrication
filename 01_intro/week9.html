<h4>  Creating the Owl Interface- Spinning owl head with a camera (Chase)</h4>
<p> 
  In a three people group, we envisaged merging art and tech, such that we would have a spinning owl head rotating with a camera, which would send pictures to a live server.
  I was touched by a film I saw Blue Communique, which inspired my to propose using the owl in the science project. The feeling of Blue Comminuque which I had hoped to encapsulate was one that creates meaning with technology- and lends a mythology to something as mechanical as a motor or drone. Chase wrote most of the code for the project and I had to miss that class due to sickness but I am assured the machine had a deeper dimension. 
    From what I gather the ESP 32 cam used the following code:

    <div>
        Why? 
        I wanted to learn how to make LED acrylic sign boards and this was an impromptu version that I created whilst I took time off from my final project fixtures.   
    </div>
    <div>
        What I am using? 
        Handsaw for cutting wood 
        Handsaw for cutting acrylic 
        Drill with engraving forefront to mark the "PS"
        Printer for getting the rainbow design 
        LED lights to glorify the design
