<h3>2D Cutting</h3>

    <b> Vinyl Cutter: Printing a logo for "Enya App: Snackpass for EU and India" </b>
      <h4>Documentation</h4>
      <p> <a href = "./enyaapplogo.png"> 1. Logo Files </a>  <a href = "enyalogoweek2.jpeg"> 2. Laptop Sticker </a>. I printed out the laptop sticker with a vinyl cutter after a couple of unsucessful attempts. The earlier attempts failed because of the razor not cutting sharply through the material.

      </i>I had developed the concept of the app for 2 years and so it was nice to be able to turn the new logo into a laptop sticker. The conept of the app is its a socially powered food commerce app hence the dishplate on the e. While the margins on thinner on restaurants than a slice of roman pizza due to the price undercutting by competitors, a socially powered way of helping users place orders and get priority pricing for dishes helps restaurants make more money and users make more informed consumer decisions, which account for other people's digital inputs on food experiences. The ability for users to have a collective picture of the whole and serve as brand ambassadors such that a group of users can earn a ladder of rewards for the social interaction and information is a generally underexplored area in British, European or Indian schools today and so I was excited to see this logo come to print. </i>
